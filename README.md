# Splashes of Color
A brand spanking new update of my portfolio site, updated from head to toe from the first time since 2016. Originally created using static pages in PHP with a gallery using [Coppermine Gallery](https://coppermine-gallery.net/). This new version, the biggest thing I wanted to do was marry my two skill sets: coding and illustration and I knew from the start I wanted something interactive, such as having the visitor 'paint' in a specially created art piece. Not only that but I wanted to create my own personal gallery/portfolio app rather than rely on someone elses's; all while using new and updated tech. I think I did a fairly good job.


## The Site

##### The Main Page
The first thing I did was entirely scrap using PHP and instead use React for my front end. For my chosen piece of tech for interactivity  I settled on drawing with canvas, a challenge on its own but even more so when combined with React. In Javascript a canvas pulls and manipulates elements directly from the DOM... something React does _NOT_ do. Needless to say making the two work was a learning process but I got there in the end!

##### The Rest
The rest of the content on my site is handled by Contentful with React Router helping to navigate through the various pages on my site! I'm happy to say that my styling is responsive and mobile friendly, even the interactive canvas–– all created with Sass. My only hope in the near future is to add some animation to my site to make it even more dynamic.
